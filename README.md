# Image Entropy

The entropy of an image can be calculated by calculating at each pixel position (i,j) the entropy of the pixel-values within a 2-dim region centered at (i,j). In the following example the entropy of a grey-scale image is calculated and plotted. The region size is configured to be (2N x 2N) = (10,10).
